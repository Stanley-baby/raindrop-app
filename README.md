# Raindrop-compatible Bookmark Service

An MIT-licensed, independently operated bookmarking service with a
Cloudflare Worker backend, Web client, and browser extensions. Each operator
deploys their own data plane; this repository does not connect clients to a
shared hosted service.

## Self-hosting

The backend setup, Cloudflare resources, secrets, migrations, and client-origin
configuration are documented in [`SELF_HOSTING.md`](SELF_HOSTING.md) and
[`cloudflare/README.md`](cloudflare/README.md).
The shortest path is:

```sh
npm i
cp cloudflare/wrangler.toml cloudflare/wrangler.private.toml
# edit the selfhosted block and set your Cloudflare resource IDs; set origins only for split-domain deployments
npx wrangler d1 migrations apply raindrop-db-selfhosted --remote \
  --config cloudflare/wrangler.private.toml --env selfhosted
npx wrangler deploy --config cloudflare/wrangler.private.toml --env selfhosted
```

Build the Web client and manually installable extension ZIPs without embedding
host-specific origins. The Web client resolves API, app, AI, archive, and
public-content URLs from the current browser origin; the self-hosted extension
asks for its Web and API roots on first install:

```sh
export REPOSITORY_URL=https://github.com/your-org/your-repo
export HELP_ORIGIN=https://github.com/your-org/your-repo
npm run build:selfhosted
npm run build:extension:selfhosted
```

Web output is written to `dist/web/selfhosted`; extension ZIPs are written to
`dist/*.zip`. Publish them through GitHub Releases and load the extensions in
browser developer mode. No app-store account or upstream repository is
required. Keep `cloudflare/wrangler.private.toml` and all secrets uncommitted.

The stable `master` branch is the release baseline. The `develop` branch is
the development branch.
