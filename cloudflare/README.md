# Cloudflare API worker

This Worker is an independently operated, self-hosted bookmarking backend.
Each operator supplies their own Cloudflare resources, domains, and secrets;
the repository does not provide a shared data plane.

## Self-hosted quick start

1. Install Node 18 and Wrangler, then authenticate with `wrangler login`.
2. Copy the committed template and keep the private copy out of Git:

   ```sh
   cp cloudflare/wrangler.toml cloudflare/wrangler.private.toml
   ```

3. Create a D1 database, two R2 buckets, and the task queues in your Cloudflare
   account. Put the returned D1 ID and your resource names in the `selfhosted`
   blocks of `cloudflare/wrangler.private.toml`; use those names in the commands
   below if they differ from the template.
4. Keep `RUNTIME_DOMAIN_MODE = "true"` and leave `API_ORIGIN`, `APP_ORIGIN`,
   and `AI_PAGE_ORIGIN` empty when Pages and API use the same public origin. The
   Worker derives the API origin from each request and defaults the Web origin
   to that same origin. If Pages and API use separate domains, set `APP_ORIGIN`
   to the Web root and `AI_PAGE_ORIGIN` to its `/ai` URL; credentialed CORS then
   accepts that configured Web origin. Keep
   `CORS_ORIGINS = "chrome-extension://*"`. Apply migrations and deploy:

   ```sh
   npx wrangler d1 migrations apply raindrop-db-selfhosted --remote \
     --config cloudflare/wrangler.private.toml --env selfhosted
   npx wrangler deploy --config cloudflare/wrangler.private.toml --env selfhosted
   ```

5. Add `SESSION_SECRET` and `ENCRYPTION_KEY` at minimum. Add email, OAuth,
   Turnstile, scanner, and Apple credentials only when you enable those
   features. Secrets are stored with `wrangler secret put` and never committed.
6. In the Cloudflare Pages project, add a Service binding named `API` pointing
   to `raindrop-api-selfhosted`, then redeploy Pages once so the binding takes
   effect. The Web build routes `/v1/*`, `/v2/*`, `/health`, `/version`,
   `/render/*`, and `/public/content/*` through that binding. Attach the
   user-selected custom domain to Pages after that; changing the Pages domain
   does not require rebuilding either project.

The committed `wrangler.toml` contains placeholders only. The ignored
`wrangler.private.toml` is the local deployment copy. The Pages `API` Service
binding means the API Worker does not need a public custom domain.

## Client builds and GitHub Releases

Build the Web client without host-specific values; API, app, AI, archive, and
public-content URLs resolve from the current browser origin at runtime:

```sh
export REPOSITORY_URL=https://github.com/your-org/your-repo
export HELP_ORIGIN=https://github.com/your-org/your-repo
npm run build:selfhosted
```

The self-hosted extension uses a runtime configuration page and does not need
build-time origins:

```sh
npm run build:extension:selfhosted
```

On first install, enter the Web and API root origins in the extension's Options
page. It requests optional access only for the API host, verifies `/health`, and
saves both origins in `storage.sync`; changing either origin later does not
require rebuilding the extension.

The Web output is written to `dist/web/selfhosted`; extension ZIPs are written
to `dist/*.zip`. When enabling OAuth, register the custom-domain callback URLs
with each identity provider (for example, `/v1/auth/google/callback`). Updating
provider allowlists does not require rebuilding the clients. Publish extension
artifacts with a GitHub Release and install the
extensions manually in browser developer mode. No browser or mobile store
account is required. Safari source is retained for operators who choose to
sign it themselves.

`wrangler.toml` keeps the top-level (default) configuration for `local` and
defines separate `preview`, `beta`, `production`, and `selfhosted` environments.
Every environment has its own Worker name, D1 database, R2 buckets, queues,
origins, and secret namespace. Replace placeholder D1 IDs before a remote
deploy. Remote custom-domain deployment requires an active Cloudflare zone for
the configured API hostname; a dry-run validates syntax and bindings but does
not provision resources or verify zone ownership.

```sh
wrangler dev --config cloudflare/wrangler.toml
wrangler deploy --config cloudflare/wrangler.toml --env preview
wrangler secret put SESSION_SECRET --config cloudflare/wrangler.toml --env beta
```

Before each remote deploy, create the environment's D1/R2/Queue resources,
put the actual D1 ID in the matching block, and set each secret with the same
`--env` value. Identity deployments require `BETA_ACCESS_PASSWORD`,
`SESSION_SECRET`, `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, and
`MAIL_FROM`; production Apple sign-in additionally requires
`APPLE_CLIENT_ID`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID`, `APPLE_KEY_ID`, and `APPLE_PRIVATE_KEY`.
The matching public `TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` is supplied only to
the Web build. Apply the D1 migrations before deploying the Worker.

The client build selects the same profiles with `--env environment=preview` or
the self-hosted scripts `npm run build:selfhosted` and
`npm run build:extension:selfhosted`.
The versioned `/v1` route manifest and request fixtures live in
`contracts/v1-routes.json` and `contracts/v1-fixtures.json`; the contract suite
checks their OpenAPI operations and QA dimensions. Run it with
`npm run test:contract`. The alert taxonomy and recovery steps are in
`OPERATIONS_RUNBOOK.md`.

The AI page is served at `/ai` and is embedded by the existing Stella iframe.
Authenticated clients use `/v2/ai/config`, `/v2/ai/context`, `/v2/ai/chat` (SSE),
`/v2/ai/suggestions`, `/v2/ai/description-draft`, and `/v2/ai/history`. Workers
AI is the default provider. Users can test and save an optional Custom AI
Provider through `/v2/ai/provider` using a public HTTPS OpenAI-compatible
endpoint; its API key is encrypted at rest and never returned. Set `AI_MODEL` to a Workers AI model
with the Function calling capability (the profiles default to
`@cf/meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct-fp8-fast`). AI capacity and quota are managed
by Cloudflare Workers AI; the application does not impose a per-user or global
AI limit. Chat requests include an explicit `provider` (`workers_ai` or
`custom`); provider failures expose a retry-or-switch choice without sending the same context automatically. The AI page uses the same
environment's Pages origin (`/ai`) so the Stella iframe and session cookie stay
on the deployed Beta app. Context requests include authorized Bookmark metadata
and Highlights only; Snapshots and attachments are excluded by default. Drafts
are returned for editing and are never written until the User explicitly applies
them.

The settings page loads the complete Workers AI catalog from `/v2/ai/models` and
stores the selected model and thinking level in the User config. Models marked
with reasoning metadata expose a thinking switch and low/medium/high level;
custom providers display their saved model name and can opt into one documented
reasoning protocol. To enable AI Gateway routing and live usage, set
`AI_GATEWAY_ID` and `CF_ACCOUNT_ID` in the environment and store
`CF_API_TOKEN` as a Worker secret with AI Gateway Read and Workers AI Read
permissions. Workers AI calls then include the Gateway binding options, while
`/v2/ai/quota?days=30` reads the credit balance, billing history, Gateway logs,
per-model totals, daily history, and low-balance alert state. The settings page
renders these values without exposing the Cloudflare token. Set
`AI_GATEWAY_LOW_BALANCE_THRESHOLD` to change the alert threshold; the default
is 5 credits. Custom API calls remain outside Gateway accounting unless the
provider is separately routed through AI Gateway.

AI Tools are exposed through `GET /v2/ai/tools` and authorized read execution on
`POST /v2/ai/tools`. Bookmark writes use `POST /v2/ai/action-proposals` and
remain pending until `POST /v2/ai/action-proposals/:id/decision` receives
`approve`, `reject`, or `always_approve`. Standing approvals are stored per User,
write Tool, and Collection through `/v2/ai/approvals`; deleting an approval
revokes it. Every application rechecks the current Bookmark and Collection role,
so a standing approval never bypasses normal permissions. Workers AI chat
requests pass the same read/write tool catalog; read calls return authorized
context, while write calls create proposals without applying mutations.

Each profile also sets `USAGE_QUOTA_DAILY` (default `1000`) and
`RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` (default `60`). Authenticated write requests consume
one daily usage unit; every `/v1` route uses a per-user or privacy-preserving
client rate bucket. A rejected request returns `429`, `Retry-After`,
`retryAfter`, and `retryAt`. D1 `audit_records` and `alerts` store only actor,
route, resource identifiers, outcome, and numeric reason metadata—never request
bodies, cookies, passwords, tokens, page contents, or attachment contents.

Bookmark saves create an idempotent `metadata_enrichment` task for public
HTTP(S) URLs. The Queue consumer follows redirects manually and validates each
target, records progress in `background_tasks`, retries failures three times
with backoff, then marks the task `dead_letter` and exposes `POST
/v1/tasks/:id/retry` for an explicit retry.
When `FETCH_DNS_RESOLVER` is configured, each hostname is resolved over HTTPS
and private or non-public A/AAAA answers are rejected before the fetch.

V1.5 duplicate detection is enabled with `DUPLICATE_CHECK_V15_ENABLED=true`.
`POST /v1/duplicates/scan` creates a Queue-backed `duplicate_scan` task; the
worker indexes HTTP(S) URLs in batches, groups exact and allow-listed tracking
parameter variants, and exposes review groups through `GET /v1/duplicates`.
Resolving a group uses `POST /v1/duplicates/:id/resolve`: dismissals are
non-destructive, while merges snapshot every affected Bookmark, move absorbed
records to the Recycle Bin, and can be undone with
`POST /v1/duplicates/merge/:id/undo`. The scan never performs an external fetch
and never merges records across Users.

Protected content is stored only in the private `CONTENT_BUCKET`. When
`ATTACHMENT_SCAN_ENABLED=true`, uploads are limited to `ATTACHMENT_MAX_BYTES`
(50 MiB in every profile), start quarantined, and enqueue an `attachment_scan`
task. Set `SCANNER_URL` and
`SCANNER_API_KEY` as Worker secrets for a scanner that returns `clean: true` or
an approved/cleared status before downloads become available. `POST
/v1/raindrop/:id/capture` is the only path that creates a Dynamic Capture task;
the Beta Worker uses the `BROWSER` Browser Run binding, stores the result
privately, and applies the same safety check.
Downloads use `/v1/content/:id/download` and never expose an R2 object URL.

V2 Web Archive uses the same private content bucket and Queue consumer. Enable
`ARCHIVE_V2_ENABLED=true` and `ARCHIVE_AUTO_CAPTURE=true` only after applying
`migrations/0030_web_archive.sql`. `POST /v1/raindrop/:id/archive` queues a
rendered, sanitized snapshot; `GET /v1/raindrop/:id/archive` returns its state,
and `/v1/archive/:version/view` serves only cleared content with a restrictive
CSP. The capture task validates every page and asset URL with the existing
public-address checks, stores HTML/assets as protected content, and records
failure reasons without putting page bodies into logs. Set `ARCHIVE_SCAN_ENABLED`
to `true` with the scanner configured before enabling automatic capture in a
shared environment. The existing `/cache` client path remains a compatibility
alias while the Web client uses the archive endpoint directly.

Beta currently sets `ATTACHMENT_SCAN_ENABLED=false`, so attachments remain
private but are marked Cleared immediately and do not enqueue a scanner task.
Set it to `true` before enabling `SCANNER_URL` and `SCANNER_API_KEY` for
quarantine-first uploads.

Collections support one-time invitations through `collection/:id/sharing` and
`collaborators/join`. Roles are Owner, Editor, and Viewer; a role granted on a
Parent Collection is inherited by its descendants and is never silently
weakened by a lower child role. Ownership changes use the explicit
`collection/:id/transfer` route.

Public Collections expose a stable link containing the numeric Resource ID and
mutable slug. Bookmark metadata is public only when the Collection is public;
Protected Content and Saved-page Snapshots remain private until the Owner
explicitly publishes a Cleared Snapshot through
`collection/:id/published-snapshots`. Public snapshot streams still go through
the Worker and never expose an R2 object URL.

Migration Archives use `POST /v1/import/preflight` with JSON (`collections`,
`bookmarks`, `attachments`, `covers`, and `snapshots`, or `items`) or a JSON
multipart file. Protected Content is carried inline and retained privately.
The response lists duplicate Bookmarks before any write. Submit explicit
`keep`/`skip` choices to
`/v1/import/:id/review`, then start the resumable `migration_import`
Background Task with `/v1/import/:id/commit`. `/v1/import/:id/status` and the
existing `/v1/tasks/:id` endpoint expose progress; `/v1/import/:id/mappings`
lists each source identifier and its assigned Resource ID (numeric for
Collections and Bookmarks, opaque for Protected Content). Per-source keys make
retries idempotent, while a failed task can be retried explicitly with
`/v1/import/:id/retry`. A skipped duplicate maps to the existing Resource ID so
the source identifier remains traceable without creating a second Bookmark.
When scanning is enabled, import status also reports child safety tasks and
their pending or failed state; an explicit retry requeues failed safety tasks.

Public release identity and API access are exposed through the existing Web paths:
`/v1/auth/apple`, `/v1/user/tfa`, and `/v1/developer/tokens`. Developer Tokens
are returned only at creation, store only a keyed hash, enforce explicit scopes,
and expire or revoke independently of Device Sessions. OAuth Clients use
`/v1/oauth/authorize` and `/v1/oauth/access_token` (also available as
`/v1/oauth/token`) with an explicit, session-bound consent step, exact redirect
URI matching, and mandatory S256 PKCE;
bearer access is accepted by the scoped `/v1` read/write routes in non-Beta
environments without changing the Beta cookie-session contract.
